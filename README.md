DarkDroid is an advanced Android ADB Exploitation Framework designed for penetration testers, security researchers, and ethical hackers. It provides a powerful yet user-friendly command-line interface to interact with Android devices via ADB (Android Debug Bridge) for security assessments, vulnerability testing, and post-exploitation activities.

✨ Key Features
✔ ADB Automation – Execute ADB commands seamlessly with an intuitive menu-driven interface.
✔ Payload Generation – Create Metasploit-compatible Android payloads (reverse/bind TCP).
✔ APK Binding – Inject malicious payloads into legitimate APKs for penetration testing.
✔ Listener Control – Start/stop Metasploit listeners directly from the tool.
✔ Data Exfiltration – Pull files/folders from a compromised device.
✔ Remote Control – Push files, install APKs, and execute shell commands.
✔ Device Management – Reboot devices, capture screenshots, and gather system info.
✔ Beautiful Terminal UI – Colorful, organized, and easy to navigate.

🎯 Use Cases
Penetration Testing – Assess Android device security.

Red Teaming – Simulate real-world attacks in authorized engagements.

Security Research – Analyze Android vulnerabilities and exploits.

Forensics – Extract data from rooted/unrooted devices.

⚠️ Important Note
This tool is strictly for ethical hacking, security research, and authorized penetration testing. Unauthorized use against devices you don’t own or have permission to test is illegal. Always comply with local laws and obtain proper authorization.

Why Use DarkDroid?
Simplifies ADB Exploitation – No need to remember complex ADB commands.

All-in-One Tool – Combines payload generation, listener control, and device interaction.

Open-Source & Customizable – Modify and extend as needed.

📌 Example Use Case
Generate a reverse TCP payload (android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp).

Bind it to a legitimate APK (e.g., a game or utility app).

Install the malicious APK on a target Android device.

Start a Metasploit listener within DarkDroid.

Gain a Meterpreter shell when the victim runs the app.

📜 Legal & Ethical Usage
🚫 Do not use for illegal activities.
✅ Use only on devices you own or have explicit permission to test.
