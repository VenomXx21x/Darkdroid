# Darkdroid üîì

A Professional Android ADB Exploitation Framework for Ethical Security Research

---
---

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è
**Darkdroid** DarkDroid leverages ADB and Metasploit to simulate post-exploitation scenarios:


### Use Cases:
- **Generate** a payload (e.g., android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp).
- **Bind** it to an APK or deploy directly via ADB.
- **Start a listener** to catch the shell session.
- **Interact** with the compromised device (ethical use only).
