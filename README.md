DarkDroid 🔓
A Professional Android ADB Exploitation Framework for Ethical Security Research
🔍 Description
DarkDroid is an advanced Android ADB Exploitation Framework designed for ethical hackers, penetration testers, and security researchers. It simulates real-world attack vectors via ADB (Android Debug Bridge) to demonstrate vulnerabilities, educate on defense strategies, and test device security in authorized environments.
⚠️ Ethical Note:
This tool is strictly for educational purposes, penetration testing, and authorized security assessments. Unauthorized use is illegal.

🚀 Features
✔ ADB Automation – Execute complex ADB commands via a user-friendly CLI.
✔ Payload Generator – Create Metasploit-compatible Android payloads (reverse/bind TCP).
✔ APK Binder – Inject payloads into legitimate APKs (for penetration testing).
✔ Listener Control – Start/stop Metasploit handlers directly from the tool.
✔ Device Interaction – Pull/push files, install APKs, reboot devices, and more.
✔ Forensics Mode – Capture screenshots, dump device info, and analyze system data.
✔ Sleek Terminal UI – Dark-themed, color-coded, and intuitive.

⚙️ How It Works
DarkDroid leverages ADB and Metasploit to simulate post-exploitation scenarios:

Generate a payload (e.g., android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp).

Bind it to an APK or deploy directly via ADB.

Start a listener to catch the shell session.

Interact with the compromised device (ethical use only).
