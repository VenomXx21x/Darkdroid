# Darkdroid 🔓

A Professional Android ADB Exploitation Framework for Ethical Security Research

---
---

## How It Works ⚙️
**Darkdroid** DarkDroid leverages ADB and Metasploit to simulate post-exploitation scenarios:


### Use Cases:
- **Generate** a payload (e.g., android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp).
- **Bind** it to an APK or deploy directly via ADB.
- **Start a listener** to catch the shell session.
- **Interact** with the compromised device (ethical use only).

Select a platform to simulate brute force attack:
1. Facebook
2. Instagram
3. LinkedIn
4. Telegram
Enter your choice (1-4): 1
Enter the target username: john_doe
Enter the path to your password list file: passwords.txt
[+] Starting brute force on Facebook for user: john_doe
[-] Trying password: password123
[-] Trying password: 123456
[+] Correct password found: securepassword123
