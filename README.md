DarkDroid 🔓
A Professional Android ADB Exploitation Framework for Ethical Security Research
🔍 Description
DarkDroid is an advanced Android ADB Exploitation Framework designed for ethical hackers, penetration testers, and security researchers. It simulates real-world attack vectors via ADB (Android Debug Bridge) to demonstrate vulnerabilities, educate on defense strategies, and test device security in authorized environments.

⚠️ Ethical Note:
This tool is strictly for educational purposes, penetration testing, and authorized security assessments. Unauthorized use is illegal.

⚙️ How It Works
DarkDroid leverages ADB and Metasploit to simulate post-exploitation scenarios:

Generate a payload (e.g., android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp).

Bind it to an APK or deploy directly via ADB.

Start a listener to catch the shell session.

Interact with the compromised device (ethical use only).
